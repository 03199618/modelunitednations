            I create this website to solve a problem:
          %p
            It is the 21st century and, still, most Model United Nations conferences are managed with crude tools. Tools that with today's technology can be enhanced, drastically. Organizing a conference will be fun again.
            %br
            %br
          %h4
            But there is more to this than just this little problem.
          %p
            I knew that someday somebody would try to solve this problem as well.
            And I knew that they would want to make money out of it.
            Make it a business about money, not about people.
            %br
            %br
            And I also knew that it would kill the love of many conferences.
            %br
            So I created this website.
            %br
            For you.
            %br
            %br

            Because I do not care about money.

            %br
            %br
            %em
              I care about you.
